# ⏱️ Time-Based Device Control System using LPC2148

## 📘 Overview

This embedded system project implements a **Time-Based Device Control (On/Off)** mechanism using the **LPC2148 ARM7 microcontroller**. It allows users to view and set real-time clock (RTC) values and schedule device operation through a **4x4 keypad** and **16x2 LCD** interface. Devices (e.g., LEDs) are turned ON or OFF based on scheduled times.

This type of project is useful in home automation, agriculture watering systems, industrial machine control, etc.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Display current **date** and **time** on LCD using RTC.
- Allow **user interaction via keypad** to set date/time and schedule.
- Let the user configure **ON time** and **OFF time** for device.
- Automatically control device (LED) based on the schedule.
